# SocialHaterBert: Detecting hate messages on Twitter: a study based on profiles within the social network.

This project comprises both an in-depth study of the efforts and techniques used so far for the detection and prevention of hateful content and cyberbullying on the popular social network Twitter, as well as a proposal for a novel approach for feature analysis based on user profiles, related social environment and generated tweets. It has been found that the contribution of user characteristics plays a significant part on gaining a deeper understanding of hate virality in the network, so that this work has allowed to open the field of study and break the textual boundaries giving rise to future research in combined models from a diachronic and dynamic perspective.
